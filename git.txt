multiple people can work on the same project
allows for collaboration

1. setup github account
2. we should use terminal

ok, so
1. create a new repository online
2. make it public, and initialize it with a readme
3. clone or donwloand - USE SSH - copy link to keyboard
4. go to the terminal
5. go to the folder where the project is
    a. in terminal
    b. then, commands
        - git clone // and then the link
            - it means clone this project from github.com
                - i guess from out computer to there
        - IN THE folder on the computer, now we got a new folder
            - .git folder, hidder
                - this one allows to communicate with github
        - now, we can copy the actual project files and put them into the background-generator folder - the one that was created by cloning
6. now, in terminal, we go into the github project - background generator in this case
    a. in terminal, this folder will be shown as master folder
    b. now we can look our files
7. now, we need to sync files so that files on our computer are on the actual github online
    - git status
        - this command shows status of our files - commited, tracked and so on
    - git add filename
        - for all files DO 
            - git add .
        - this way we are adding files for tracking
    - git status again
        - now, we have added files that need to be commited (synced, i guess)
8. now, we commit our changes
    - we are commiting our changes 
        - we can add message to the commit
        - git commit -m "adding starting project"
9. now, we need to let github.com know that these are the changes
    - git push
    - and now, files are online on github

/// ok, now we need to have other people work on the project
- so they need to pick it up from the repository

1. so we go to our folder where the project will be on our computer
    - we do the same, we clone the repository - the link from github.com
        git clone https://github.com/ikaem/background-generator.git

now we are working with files 
ok, move on
    - lets say we work on files in master directory
        - and we change a file
        - and then if check git status, we will see that a file has been modified
    - WE NEED TO BE IN A FOLDER THAT HAS .GIT FOLDER IN IT
    - there might be issue with setting upstream something...
    - ok, so we go online, to the branch, and we create a pull request
    - there is an option to requeste a merge pull - so we can merge the branch with the master, where branch changes will be in the master

    POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
    lets move on, and create a big feature
